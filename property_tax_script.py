# === GEMINI PROMPT === #

Extract structured property tax data from each uploaded property assessment and tax levy PDF. Each PDF contains data for a single property.

Return a flat structured table (CSV or list of JSON objects). Each row must include the following columns:

- Property Address
- Roll Number
- Assessment Value
- Year (2021 to 2025)
- Tax Rate Used
- Property Tax
- First Half Payment (50% of the previous year's Property Tax)
- Second Half Payment (Property Tax - First Half), except for 2025
- Monthly Payment (Property Tax Ã· 12)

Year-by-Year Calculation Rules:

1. **Tax Rate Used**:
   - Extract from PDF if shown.
   - If missing, use these City of Kingston residential tax rates:
     - 2020: 1.309528%
     - 2021: 1.365454%
     - 2022: 1.399366%
     - 2023: 1.444608%
     - 2024: 1.478321%
     - 2025: 1.556000% (only if confirmed)

2. **Property Tax**:
   - Extract from PDF if available.
   - If missing, calculate as:
     `Property Tax = Assessment Value Ã— Tax Rate Used`

3. **First Half Payment**:
   - For 2021:
     - Use the 2020 tax calculated as:
       `Assessment Value Ã— 1.309528%`
     - First Half = 50% of that amount
   - For 2022 to 2025:
     - First Half = 50% of the **previous yearâ€™s** Property Tax
       (use either extracted or calculated value)

4. **Second Half Payment**:
   - For 2021 to 2024:  
     `Second Half = Property Tax - First Half`
   - For 2025:  
     `Second Half = 0.0` (2025 final bill not yet available)

5. **Monthly Payment**:
   - `Monthly = Property Tax Ã· 12`

Output Format & Requirements:

- Always extract Property Address and Roll Number exactly as shown in the PDF.
- Use year-specific Assessment Values if available; otherwise reuse the only one listed.
- Round all numeric values (taxes, rates, payments) to 2 decimal places.
- Output must be clean, machine-readable (CSV or JSON).
- Do not leave any fields blank or null unless data is entirely unavailable and cannot be inferred.

Goal:

To automate the accurate and complete extraction of property tax records across 2021 to 2025, reflecting the City of Kingston's billing model â€” including interim/final split logic, default rate handling, and safeguards for missing future data like 2025â€™s final tax.
